# AnchorSwap ActionBar

AnchorSwap ActionBar is a World of Warcraft addon that enhances your gaming
experience by providing anchored pagination for your action bar. Originally
designed to complement the [ShaguController](https://shagu.org/ShaguController/)
addon, it has been released separately for the convenience of players who may
find it useful.

## Features

- **Anchored Pagination**: Automatically returns the action bar to its default
pagination after a set period of inactivity (default: 5 seconds), after using a
pageable action bar shortcut, or after exiting combat.
- **Enhanced Gameplay**: Enjoy a smoother gaming experience with streamlined
action bar navigation.


## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](link).
2. Extract the files into your World of Warcraft `AddOns` folder.

## Usage

AnchorSwap ActionBar works seamlessly in the background once installed.
Simply play the game as usual, and the addon will handle the action bar
pagination for you.

## Note

This addon is provided as-is. While it was originally created to complement
ShaguController, there are no guarantees of compatibility or ongoing support.
Feel free to fork the repository and create your own version of the addon if
needed.
